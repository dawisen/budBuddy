# Bud Buddy
Bud Buddy is like a friend who helps you take care of your plants, if your friend was an expert in plant facts and reminding you when to water your leaf babies.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, React, Bootstrap

This project started as a [Pearl Hacks](https://devpost.com/software/bud-buddy) hackathon project and was created in under 24 hours. We designed a website with search filtering, data mapping, and pulled data from a JSON file as a stand-in for an API call/connected database. I intend to keep building and updating it until it is a full-stack application. 

## Lessons Learned:
It is very difficult to build a full-stack application in under 24 hours (shock). Despite the crunch, I loved the process of creating this project and working with my group. We were proud of what we accomplished, considering we were all beginners at using React and to coding in general. 

## Future Additions:
I plan to serve this project using AWS, add user authentication and web scraping for plant data, and store it using Amazon Aurora. I also want to add a notification system so that users get reminders for when to water their plants.
